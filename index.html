		  <p>Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation (released internationally as Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation[7] or simply Hotel Transylvania 3 as marketed on home release) is a 2018 American computer-animated monster comedy film produced by Sony Pictures Animation and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The third installment in the Hotel Transylvania franchise and the sequel to Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015), it was directed by Genndy Tartakovsky and written by Tartakovsky and Michael McCullers, and features Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, Sadie Sandler, David Spade, Keegan-Michael Key, Joe Whyte, Asher Blinkoff, Chris Parnell and Mel Brooks reprising their roles, as well as new additions to the cast including Jim Gaffigan, Kathryn Hahn, Joe Jonas, Chrissy Teigen and Tartakovsky. In the film, Dracula finds love with a ship captain named Ericka while on a vacation on a cruise liner with his family and friends, but Mavis later discovers that Ericka is actually the great-granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing, Drac's arch-enemy.

Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival on June 13, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 13. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics and grossed $528 million worldwide against a budget of $80 million. It is the highest-grossing film in the Hotel Transylvania series and Sony Pictures Animation's highest-grossing film worldwide to be completely animated. The sequel, Hotel Transylvania: Transformania, was scheduled to be released theatrically on October 1, 2021, with Brian Hull and Brad Abrell taking over the roles of Dracula and Frankenstein from Adam Sandler and Kevin James, respectively.[8][9][10] On August 16, Sony Pictures Releasing was in negotiations to sell the film's distribution rights to Amazon Studios for $100 million, due to rising cases of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in the United States.[11]</p>

	   <p>Saw it today and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>
